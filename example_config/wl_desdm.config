# This file has some typical changes for when desdm runs the code.
# The recommended mode is to use the + option on the command line to 
# read a second config file.
#
# e.g.
# measureshear $(INSTALL_DIR)/etc/wl.config $(INSTALL_DIR)/etc/wl_desdm.config
#
# This will read the base wl.config file first, and then read this file.
# Anything set in this file would then supersede the values set by the 
# first configuration file.

# generally best to maximize this number such that it doesn't overflow the 
# available memory (leading to heavy swaps to disk).

# is needed here.
