Compiling:

In the root directory of the distribution:

	scons IMPORT_PATHS=True
	scons install PREFIX=/some/path

The import paths command means it will look in LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
C_INCLUDE_PATH for libraries and header files (sich as the needed tmv,
atlas/blas, cfitsio).

If you have n processors you can speed up the compilation with
	scons -j $n IMPORT_PATHS=True

The main executables measurepsf and measureshear will be copied into the
$PREFIX/bin directory.

Running the code:

measurepsf configure_file root=/full/path/to/image/without_extension
measureshear configure_file root=/full/path/to/image/without_extension

These programs use the same configuration file.  Using the root method
the files are assumed to have the basic root name and all live under
that same directory.  For more control over names you can specify
the following on the command lie:

	image_file=
	allcat_file=
	starcat_file=
	psf_file=
	shear_file=
	fitpsf_file=
	
as well as many other things.  See example_config/wl.config for examples.
